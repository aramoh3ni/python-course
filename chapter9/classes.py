# NOTE:: CLASSES
# Object-oriented programming is one of the mose effective approaches to writing soft-ware. 
# in OOP we write (classes) that represent real-world things and situations, and we create (objects) based on the classes.

# Making an object from a class is called instantioation
# and we work with instnaces in class.

# we store our classes as module and import them every where we need them.

# Creating And Using Class
# from dog import Dog

# x = Dog("Afghan",3)
# x.sit()
# x.roll_over()

# the __init__() Method
# called constructor
# python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance of class

# Createing Instace from a class
# from dog import Dog
# dog = Dog("tom", 1.5) # Creating Instance of a class or creating object of a class

# Accessing Attributes
# new_dog = Dog("tom", 2)
# print(new_dog.name) # Access class attributies.

# Calling Methods
# new_dog = Dog("tom", 2)
# new_dog.sit() # call functions inside class

# Creating Multiple Instances
# first_dog = Dog("tom", 2)
# second_dog = Dog("petee", 1)

# print(first_dog.name)
# print(second_dog.name)

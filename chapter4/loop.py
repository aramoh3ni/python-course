# Loop 
# allow to us to take the same action or set of action, with every item in a list
# any length, includeing 1000, items in the lists

# Loop through an entire list
# magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
# message = "{},ðŸ§™ that was a great trick!"
# message2 = "Hope to see you in the next challenge, {}\n"
# for magician in magicians:
#     print(message.format(magician.title()))
#     print(message2.format(magician.title()))

# print("Next Magician Day is on April, 1")

# Indentation Errors
# for magician in magicians:
# print(message.format(magician.title()))
#     print(message2.format(magician.title()))

# Code Indentation is too much important otherwaise we get error
# if we didn't add space before code (indentation) after lope statment
# we will never get error but codes after lope statement will run
# only once
# Forgetting to indent additional lines
# for magician in magicians:
#     print(message.format(magician.title()))
#     print(message2.format(magician.title()))
#
# print("Next Magician Day is on April, 1")
# NOTE:: If we indenting print() method for second time
# for magician in magicians:
#     print(magician)
# print(magician)
# ----------------------------
# valid Syntax Python code but it goint to error logically
# Logical Error


# (:) colon after loop statment tells python to interpret the next
# line a part of a loop.

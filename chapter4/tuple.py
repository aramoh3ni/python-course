# NOTE:: Tuples
# in typles values cannot change as immutable, and immutable 
# list is called tuple

# myTuple = (200, 100)
# print(myTuple)

# We Cannot assign value in tuple
# print(myTuple[1] = 100) # error

# if we have one parameter in tuple() we must to add (,) after # # first value otherwise it will return current arrgument as value # no tuple
# x = (200,) # (200,)
# print(x)

# x = (200) # 200 
# print(x)

# Looping through all values in a tuple
# names = ("Alireza", "Mohseni")
# for name in names:
#     print(name)

# We can't assign or update values of tupe but we cant over write # the tuple
# dimensions = (200, 100, 2, 100, 3003, 203)
# print("Original Dimensions: ")
# for dimension in dimensions:
#     print(dimension)

# dimensions = (100, 10, 2002,120201, 0.1)
# print("\nOverwrite DimensionsL ")
# for dimension in dimensions:
#     print(dimension)
